# Quicksort Implementation in Rust

This is a Rust implementation of the quicksort algorithm for integers.

## Description

This implementation includes:
- A partition function that arranges elements around a pivot
- A recursive quicksort function that sorts integers
- A simple command-line interface to demonstrate the sorting

## Usage

To run the program:

```bash
